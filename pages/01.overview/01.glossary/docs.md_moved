_B2C_  
Tool for linking orders to different sources, typically to track sales from social media channels. An Affiliate can use it by inserting a pixel or a code snippet with a specific URL into their own channels.

The reserved funds often show as "blocked" in the purchaser's account. Payment authotization is enough to complete the payment in Centra and finalize placing the order, payment capture usually occurs later. Payment authorization can be cancelled before capture occurs, but not after.

### **Payment capture**  
This is the second part of the payment, when the funds are actually transferred from the account of the purchaser to the merchant account. Payments that have been captured can no longer be cancelled, they should be refunded instead, if needed. Remember, that depending on the Payment Service Provider and the payment method used, there is a maximum time limit between authorization and capture (usually between 14 and 30 days).

Other statics can define store terms and conditions, or items to be used in the Front End - a static button text or footer content. There are some pre-existing statics, and the customer has the option to add their own. Statics are defined by their name, type and the Store they’re configured for.

### **Store**  
_B2B/B2C_  
Centra can have multiple stores in the same instance. The usual setup is to have two stores - one for B2C and one for B2B. It is however possible to have more than one B2C store if needed. Each Store can have its own plugins configured. Each Store also has its own structure in terms of Brand, Categories, Pricelists and so forth. In a more general term a Store is a separate sales channel. However, if you are to create two Wholesale stores they will share the same invoice number, hence you can not use stores for a multi company setup in B2B/Wholesale if you want to create Invoices.

### **Supplier**  
_B2B/B2C_  
A Supplier in Centra is from where your products are purchased or manufactured. It’s from a supplier you can create supplier orders and supplier orders can be shown in the Order API for integrations with either supplier or warehouses.
