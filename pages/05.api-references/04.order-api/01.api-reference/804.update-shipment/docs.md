# Update shipment

`PUT  *base*/shipments/*shipmentId*`
Authentication : [API Key](/api-references/api-intro#authentication)
This will modify the products on the shipment, keeping the same `shipmentId`. This function is designed for creation and modification of new shipments, meaning it will *not* work on existing shipments which:

* Have been shipped,
* Have been captured or paid, or
* Have any returns.

The only exception to this rule is setting GTG (Good to Go) or setting serial numbers on serializable product lines. This you can do at any point.

To be able to use this call, you need to create a shipment using `"capture": false` so the create shipment call is not trying to capture the money.

[notice-box=alert]
If the automatic capture when creating shipments is disabled, to avoid sending shipments that has not been captured you need to :ref:`Capture Shipment <order-api-capture-shipment>` before you ship it.
[/notice-box]

If you need to remove the shipment, use the [Delete Shipment](/api-references/order-api/api-reference/delete-shipment) method.

## Parameters

[/parameter]

[parameter data="key in object" datatype="string" isRequired=true sublevel=2]
