### Installation

Each API has its own plugin. Some of the APIs need activation from Centra, such as the subscription API, but the other ones can be easily enabled by adding a new plugin to your store.

To enable a plugin in Centra, go to `SYSTEM`, then select `STORES`. Select what store you want your API to connect to and select the API in the list of plugins. You will need administration rights to have access to `SYSTEM`.

### Endpoints

Every API installed in Centra gets its own API-endpoint. This endpoint will then be the prefix of every API-call. In the documentation, this value is called `<base>`.

### Authentication

For authentication we use the API key, which is a shared secret generated in the Plugin settings of the API. You can use the `API-authorization: foo` header with the token. The overview section of each API Reference might also define other rules of how to authenticate.

Example request:

`curl -H "API-Authorization foo" <base>/orders`
