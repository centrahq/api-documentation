Our policy at Centra is to handle your personal information in a safe and honest way. In order to give you a better understanding of how we handle your personal data, we have, in accordance with the GDPR EU Directive, developed a Privacy Policy.
 
When you fill out one of our contact forms, sign up for our newsletter, sign up for one of our events or sign up to access material about Centra that we don't have publicly available on our website, we will store and process your personal information, for the purpose of staying in touch with you about Centra, via different channels such as email, phone, social media, ads, mail, in-person meetings and/or events. 
 
We will never ever sell your personal information, share it with any 3rd party without your explicit consent, or use it for any other purpose than contacting you about Centra. 
 
We use sub-processors for storing data about you and keeping in touch with you about Centra. We use Google’s (Google LLC, a US company) service Gmail for sending emails to you, their service Google Calendar for keeping track of when we’ve agreed to speak or meet with you and their service Drive for storing any documents we might exchange. We use a CRM software from Hubspot (Hubspot, Inc., also a US company) for storing information about you, our business relationship and our interactions. Finally, we use an email marketing software from Rule.io (Rule Communication - Nordic AB, a Swedish company) to send newsletters to you. We reserve the right to change sub-processors, in which case we will update this text. We will add new sub-processors to this text at least 10 days before we start using them. If you don't want  a new sub-processor to process your personal information, just let us know and we'll of course honor your request. 
 
We will store and process whatever personal information you share about yourself, including your name, phone number and email address. If you sign up for one of our events, we store and process that as well. Our systems will also store and process your IP address, location and interactions with our website and email content, and potentially also interactions with ads, other websites and social media content, that might be picked up by tracking pixels or cookies. 
 
We include a link to unsubscribe from further communication in every newsletter we send to you. You can unsubscribe at any time. If you want to be completely forgotten, kindly let us know and we will delete all data we have about you. If you are curious about what data we have stored about you, let us know and we’re happy to share a copy. We also clean up our records at least every 2 years. If we realize that we haven't been in touch with you since our last clean up, we'll delete your personal data from our systems as part of the clean-up.
