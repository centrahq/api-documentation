# Create order

```eval_rst
.. api-name:: Order API
   :version: 1

.. endpoint::
   :method: POST
   :url: *base*/order

.. authentication::
   :api_key: true
```

This will insert a new order directly into Centra bypassing any needs of a payment. This API could be used to directly import orders from external systems. The API-plugin needs to have "Allow Order Create" set as `true` to allow this call to be made.

```eval_rst
.. warning:: Remember that payments for these orders will not be handled at all by Centra. You must make sure the payments are handled and captured elsewhere.
```

```eval_rst
.. _create-order-parameters:
```

## Parameters

      "invoiceAddress": {
          "country": "SE",
          "firstName": "John",
          "lastName": "Smith",
          "address": "12 Alto Road",
          "coaddress": "c/o Peter",
          "zipcode": "90212",
          "city": "San Francisco",
          "email": "x@example.com"
      },
      "deliveryAddress": {
          "country": "US",

      },

          {
              "qty": 2,
              "ean": "ABCDEFGHIJKL",
              "unitPrice": 14.11,
              "originalPrice": 100.11,
              "itemText" : {
                "sku": "SPECIAL-SKU-FOR-THIS-ONE",
                "product": "A special product",
                "variant": ""
              }
          },

          }
      ]
    }
```

The response will return an array of orders when the call was successful (unless you used `createOnly` set as `true`). This is because the order might have been split into different orders depending on rules inside Centra.

## Response

```eval_rst
.. list-table::
   :widths: auto

   * - ``status``

       .. type:: string
          :required: true

   * - ``orders``

       .. type:: array of int
          :required: false
