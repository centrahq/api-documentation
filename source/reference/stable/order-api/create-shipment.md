# Create shipment

```eval_rst
.. api-name:: Order API
   :version: 1

.. endpoint::
   :method: POST
   :url: *base*/shipments

.. authentication::
   :api_key: true
```

This will create a shipment and per default try to capture from the payment provider, shipment will not be created if the capture fails.

```eval_rst
.. warning:: You have the ability to turn off capture to make it possible to edit the shipment after it has been created. However, if you explicitly turn off capture using ``"capture": false``, we will not capture the money for the order automatically, and the :ref:`order-api-complete-shipment` call MUST be made and verified that it was successful until you can ship any products.
```
